Some of my favorite online resources are listed below.

**Learning how to code in Python**
* If you're totally new to coding, I like [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by Allen B. Downey
  * See also his [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/) and [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/) books for statistics
