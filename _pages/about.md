Hi, my name is [Baird](http://bairdlangenbrunner.github.io).  Welcome to the **Python for climate scientists** project.

I've set this up to document my experience as a climate scientist who uses Python as a primary language for data analysis and plotting.  My intention here is not to reinvent the Python-climate science "wheel," since there are already many great resources out there doing something like this.  Instead, I hope to organize the moving parts and create an online repository with helpful links to everything out there.

The idea is to add useful documentation on analyzing and plotting data relevant to climate science, as well as give scientist-driven tips on best practices in keeping a working Python ecosystem on your personal computer or remote machines.  I plan to add a few specific pages that discuss **great resources** out there for this, my own thoughts on **getting started with Python**, and **suggestions for staying up-to-date** with the eye-watering speed at which Python libraries and tools are evolving.

This is ALSO a way for me to brush up on my own GitHub skills.  If you're thinking of setting up a similar project yourself, don't hesitate to ask me questions on how to do it.

Please check back soon as I update this site, and let me know if you'd like to see anything specific as I get things going.

Thanks,
Baird
