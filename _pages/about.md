Hi, and welcome to the **Python for climate scientists** project!

I'm [Baird](https://bairdlangenbrunner.github.io), and I've set this up to document my experience using Python for data analysis and plotting.  My intention here is not to reinvent the wheel, since there are already many great resources out there doing something like this.  Instead, I hope to organize the moving parts and create an online repository with helpful links to everything that I've found useful.

The idea here is to offer some helpful info to those who are either new to Python or are looking to refine the tools they use most.  Moving forward, my goals here are to:
* Add some useful and practical documentation on analyzing and plotting data relevant to climate science
* Document tips on best practices in keeping a working Python ecosystem on your personal computer or remote machines
* Highlight and discuss *other* resources out there for this
* Dump out my own thoughts on getting started with Python
* Outline suggestions for staying up-to-date with the eye-watering speed at which Python libraries and tools are evolving

This is *also* a way for me to brush up on my own GitHub skills.  If you're thinking of setting up a similar project yourself, don't hesitate to ask me questions on how to do it.

Please check back soon as I update this site, and let me know if you'd like to see anything specific as I get things going.

Thanks,

Baird
