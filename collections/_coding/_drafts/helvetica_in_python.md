title: Helvetica in Python
---

I don't have a lot of complaints about Python and Matplotlib, but something that has always irked me is the default font.  It's currently DejaVu Sans, which looks a little too squat for me when comparing it to other sans serif fonts like Helvetica and Arial.

Personally, I like Helvetica, and every time I install Matplotlib anew on a machine, I make sure I get Helvetical working properly and by default with it.  It's a fairly simple process, originally described in [Olga Botvinnik back in 2012][olga-blog-entry], and I always refer back to it when I need to.
