Hi, and welcome to **Python for climate scientists**.

I've set this up to document my experience using Python for data analysis and plotting.  My intention here is not to reinvent the wheel, since there are many great resources out there doing something like this.  Instead, I hope to organize the moving parts I've seen online and create a repository that gives a good cross section of what exists already, as well as fill in some holes I've noticed.

This project is in its infancy, and I expect it to evolve in the coming months and years.  Please let me know if you want to be part of it, or if you'd like to see something specific here.
