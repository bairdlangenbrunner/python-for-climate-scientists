Hi, and welcome to **Python for climate scientists**!

This project is in its infancy, and I expected it to evolve quite a bit in the coming months and years.

I'm [Baird](https://bairdlangenbrunner.github.io), and I've set this up to document my experience using Python for data analysis and plotting.  My intention here is not to reinvent the wheel, since there are already many great resources out there doing something like this.  Instead, I hope to organize the moving parts I've seen online and create a repository that gives a good cross section of what exists already, as well as fill in some holes I've noticed.

I'd also love input from other Python users, so if you have anything you'd like to contribute, please let me know.  (Better yet, if you're GitHub-savvy, feel free to fork this repository, go wild, and send a pull request my way!)

> The idea here is to offer helpful info to those who are either new to Python or are looking to refine the tools they use most.  I'll try to cover a range of backgrounds, with a focus on Earth science data analysis.

More generally, I plan to:
* Go a little overboard with gifs
* Dump out my own thoughts on getting started with Python
* Document tips on best practices in keeping Python working on your personal computer or remote machines
* Add some useful and practical documentation on analyzing and plotting data relevant to Earth science
* Highlight and discuss *other* resources out there for this(!)

Please check back as I update the site, and <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">email me</a> if you'd like to get in touch.  I promise to respond eventually.
