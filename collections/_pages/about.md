Hi, and welcome to the **Python for climate scientists** project!

I'm [Baird](https://bairdlangenbrunner.github.io), and I've set this up to document my experience using Python for data analysis and plotting.  My intention here is not to reinvent the wheel, since there are already many great resources out there doing something like this.  Instead, I hope to organize the moving parts and create an online repository with helpful links to everything that I've found useful.

> The idea here is to offer helpful info to those who are either new to Python or are looking to refine the tools they use most.  I'll try to cover a range of backgrouns, including a "where do I start?" document.

More generally, I plan to:
* Dump out my own thoughts on getting started with Python
* Document tips on best practices in keeping Python working on your personal computer or remote machines
* Add some useful and practical documentation on analyzing and plotting data relevant to Earth science
* Highlight and discuss *other* resources out there for this(!)

This is *also* a way for me to brush up on my own GitHub skills.  If you're thinking of setting up a similar project yourself, don't hesitate to ask me questions on how to do it.

Please check back as I update the site, and <a href="mailto:{{site.email}}">email me</a>  if you'd like to see anything specific.

Cheers,  
Baird
