Hi, and welcome to **Python for climate scientists**!

My name is Baird, and I'm currently a postdoc at UC Irvine.

I started using Python toward the end of college (circa 2008), and I've watched a great Earth science user base develop around it since then.  In the past few years in particular, it seems like increasingly powerful packages are popping up and evolving for data analysis and plotting.  It's all very exciting and overwhelming at once.

Despite the fantastic options now available to Python experts and beginners alike, it seems like a community-driven website that gives information about resources and practical advice is somewhat missing.  With that in mind, my intention here is to organize these moving parts and create a platform that gives a good cross section of what resources exist already.  I'd also like to fill in some holes I've noticed and talked about with peers, and provide a space for other Python folks to do the same.

This project is in its infancy, and I expect it to evolve in the coming months and years.  And fair warning:  Please expect reorganization as I settle things, and reach out if you want to be part of this or have advice on how to improve things.  The code is available on GitHub, so if you feel particularly git-savvy (and don't mind sorting through my mess), [take a gander][github-site].

If you're new to Python and found this hoping to get started on things, check out the inaugural papers here:
* [Where to start][where-to-start-page] (spoiler: use conda!)
* A resources page to catalogue the cool stuff already out there
* Some practical examples that improve quality of life while coding, data-wrangling, and plotting geospatial data
