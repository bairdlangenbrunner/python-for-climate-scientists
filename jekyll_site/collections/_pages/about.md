Hi, and welcome to **Python for climate scientists**!

My name is Baird, and I'm currently a postdoc at UC Irvine.

I started using Python toward the end of college (circa 2008), and I've watched a great Earth science user base develop around it since then.  In the past few years in particular, it seems like increasingly powerful packages are popping up and evolving for data analysis and plotting.  It's all very exciting, but it's equally overwhelming to keep up.

I've consistently hoped for a website that gives information about these resources (and practical, scientist-driven advice on the paths of least resistance).  With that in mind, my intention here is to highlight what's out there, as well as fill in a few holes I've noticed and talked about with peers.

This project is in its infancy, so please expect reorganization as I settle things, and reach out if you want to be part of this or have advice on how to improve it.  The code is available on GitHub, so feel free to [take a gander][github-site] (and go wild if you want to contribute!).

If you're new to Python and found this hoping to get started on things, this where to start guide might help:
* [Where to start][where-to-start-page] (spoiler: use conda!)

In the near future, also look out for:
* An evolving resource page to catalogue what's out there
* Some practical examples that decrease headaches while data-wrangling and plotting
